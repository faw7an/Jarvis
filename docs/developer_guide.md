# Developer Guide for Voice Command System

## Introduction

This document is intended for developers who wish to contribute to the Voice Command System project. It provides an overview of the project structure, coding conventions, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

```
voice-command-system
├── scripts
│   ├── voice_listener.py       # Captures audio input and recognizes voice commands
│   ├── command_executor.sh      # Executes system commands based on recognized voice commands
│   └── startup.sh               # Sets up the environment and runs the voice_listener.py script on startup
├── config
│   └── commands.json            # Stores voice commands and their corresponding actions
├── utils
│   ├── speech_recognition.py    # Contains functions for speech recognition
│   └── system_actions.py        # Defines functions for executing system-level actions
├── docs
│   ├── user_guide.md            # Documentation for end-users
│   └── developer_guide.md       # Documentation for developers
├── requirements.txt             # Lists Python dependencies required for the project
├── install.sh                   # Automates the installation of dependencies and project setup
└── README.md                    # Documentation for the project
```

## Code Conventions

- **Language**: The primary language for this project is Python. Shell scripts are written in Bash.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions. Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic. Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, and classes.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice-command-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Adding New Features

1. **Identify the Feature**: Clearly define the feature you want to add and how it fits into the existing system.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Implement the Feature**: Write the code for your feature, following the coding conventions outlined above.
4. **Testing**: Ensure that your code is well-tested. Add unit tests if applicable.
5. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes made to the project.
6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push the branch to the repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Reporting Issues
